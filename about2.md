[Carson](https://cpsievert.me) enjoys developing software and creating products that make data analysis more accessible and engaging. Shortly after receiving a [PhD in statistics](https://search.proquest.com/openview/3a91971f82fd4af20a78bebb079f5035/), his work on [plotly for R](https://plotly-book.cpsievert.me/) was recognized by the [ASA](http://www.amstat.org/) with the [Chambers Award](http://stat-computing.org/awards/jmc/). In addition to formal education in math, economics, and statistics, Carson has over 7 years experience using, developing, and maintaining widely-used data science software. This diverse background

-- allowing him to attack challenging problems with domain expertise from many different areas. Whether it's a novel visualization for better model interpretation ([LDAvis](https://github.com/cpsievert/LDAvis)), or a customized (shiny) web-application for exploring multiple datasets (e.g., [zikar](https://github.com/cpsievert/zikar), [pedestrians](https://github.com/cpsievert/pedestrians), [eechidna](https://github.com/ropenscilabs/eechidna/), [bcviz](https://github.com/cpsievert/bcviz)); Carson pushes the frontier of R and JavaScript to help (himself and others) derive insight from data in a reusable, portable, reproducible, and accessible way.

During the final year of his [PhD in statistics](https://search.proquest.com/openview/3a91971f82fd4af20a78bebb079f5035/), Carson received the [ASA's Chambers Award]() for his work on [plotly for R](), and founded Sievert Consulting to aid organizations in their quest to derive insight from data.

In fact, every year, tens of thousands of people [learn to build data products](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-products) using [plotly for R](https://plotly-book.cpsievert.me/) -- a free and open-source software project he currently maintains and uses to build data products, such as:
