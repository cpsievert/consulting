[Carson](https://cpsievert.me) enjoys developing software and creating products that make data analysis more accessible and less boring. He is most well-known as the maintainer of [plotly](https://github.com/ropensci/plotly/graphs/contributors) -- the most widely used R package for creating interactive web graphics. Shortly after receiving a [PhD in statistics](https://search.proquest.com/openview/3a91971f82fd4af20a78bebb079f5035/), his contributions to plotly were recognized by the [ASA](http://www.amstat.org/) with the [Chambers Award](http://stat-computing.org/awards/jmc/). 
In addition to a formal background in math and statistics, Carson has over 7 years experience using and developing data science software -- allowing him to attack challenging problems with domain expertise from many different areas. Whether it's a novel visualization for better model interpretation ([LDAvis](https://github.com/cpsievert/LDAvis)), or a customized (shiny) web-application for exploring multiple datasets (e.g., [zikar](https://github.com/cpsievert/zikar), [pedestrians](https://github.com/cpsievert/pedestrians), [eechidna](https://github.com/ropenscilabs/eechidna/), [bcviz](https://github.com/cpsievert/bcviz)); Carson pushes the frontier of R and JavaScript to help (himself and others) derive insight from data in a reusable, portable, reproducible, and accessible way.
